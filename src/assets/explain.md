# Assets folder

The "src/assets" folder is typically used for assets that are imported and processed by JavaScript
code. These assets can include images, styles, fonts or other resources that include in
application's bundle.

Processed by Build Tools: Files in the "src/assets" folder are often processed, optimized, and
bundled by build tools (e.g., Webpack, Parcel, or Create React App) during the build process. For
example, images might be optimized, and styles might be compiled from SASS or LESS.
